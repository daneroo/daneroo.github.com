Under Centos4.4 my notes indicate that the SKGE module was the right one...<br /><br />Installing the Gigabit Ethernet Controller under RHEL5 was without issue, and produced the following /etc/modprobe.conf:<br /><blockquote>[root@cantor ~]# more /etc/modprobe.conf<br />alias eth0 r8169<br />alias eth1 forcedeth<br />...</blockquote>This is what lspci had to say:<br /><blockquote>[root@cantor ~]# lspci<br />01:09.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8169 Gigabit Ethernet (rev 10)<br /></blockquote>
